# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
The script contains two independent codes that employ Monte Carlo simulation. The first calculates the median of the people in a group required for any of their two birthdays to fall on the same week. The second uses Monte Carlo simulation to generate random walk of two particles until they collide or reach a threshold number of steps.
